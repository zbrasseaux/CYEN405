I cannot seem to get an external network connection 
in order to upload the files that have been edited
on my master virtual machine. 

Instead, I have added
new files to which I have added specifically the 
changes that I made to specific files (named 
accordingly). 

If you have any issues, email me at
zpb004@latech.edu and I will do my best to clear
up any questions that you may have. 

Thank you.
